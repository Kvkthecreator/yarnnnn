# Quora Engagement Brief — 2026-02-27

**First run — multi-position discovery across all five positions**
**Status:** Draft — pending Kevin's review and selection

## Opportunity 1 (Position 1: Autonomy Without Context)

- **Question:** "Which AI agent framework is the best?"
- **URL:** https://www.quora.com/Which-AI-agent-framework-is-the-best
- **Signals:** Active question, multiple answers, all focused on framework comparison (LangChain vs AutoGen vs CrewAI). Nobody has raised the context problem.
- **Kevin's angle:** The "which framework" question misses the actual bottleneck. Frameworks handle orchestration — the ability to chain tool calls and manage workflows. But the reason agents produce disappointing output isn't orchestration. It's that they start every task knowing nothing about you or your work. Kevin can reframe the evaluation criteria entirely.

**Draft response:**

Interesting question, but I think the framework comparison misses the more fundamental issue.

I've been building AI agent systems for about a year now, after spending 10 years building context systems in CRM/GTM. What I've found is that the framework — LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, whatever — handles the orchestration layer. It determines how tool calls chain together, how agents collaborate, how workflows execute.

But orchestration isn't where agents actually break down. They break down because they start every task with zero understanding of your actual work. Give the smartest agent the best framework, and ask it to "write my weekly client update" — it'll produce something competent and completely generic. It doesn't know your clients. It doesn't know what happened this week. It doesn't know how you like things phrased.

The real question isn't "which framework orchestrates best?" It's "how does the agent get the context it needs to produce output that's actually useful for your specific situation?"

What I've observed building in this space: the gap between model capability and useful autonomous output isn't intelligence or orchestration. It's context. The system needs to understand your work — across platforms, over time, with accumulating depth. That's an architectural problem that sits above any framework choice.

So my answer would be: pick the framework that best fits your team's technical preferences (they're all converging on similar patterns anyway). Then spend 90% of your effort on the context problem — how your agent knows enough about the user's world to produce output worth reviewing rather than rewriting.

## Opportunity 2 (Position 2: Accumulation Beats Retrieval)

- **Question:** "Why can't ChatGPT remember the entire conversation especially if used to write stories or long detailed conversations?"
- **URL:** https://www.quora.com/Why-can-t-ChatGPT-remember-the-entire-conversation-especially-if-used-to-write-stories-or-long-detailed-conversations
- **Signals:** High-traffic perennial question. Existing answers focus on token limits and context windows — technically accurate but missing the deeper architectural issue.
- **Kevin's angle:** The existing answers explain the symptom (context window limits). Kevin can explain the structural issue: LLMs are stateless by design. Even with bigger context windows, they don't accumulate understanding across sessions. The fix isn't a bigger buffer — it's a persistent context layer that builds over time.

**Draft response:**

The other answers here explain the technical mechanism well — context windows, token limits, attention mechanisms. All accurate. But I think there's a more fundamental issue worth understanding.

The "forgetting" problem isn't really about how many tokens the model can hold at once. It's about architecture. These models are stateless. Every conversation starts from zero. Even if you had infinite context, the model wouldn't understand your work the way a human colleague does after months of working together.

Think about what makes a human assistant valuable after six months on the job. It's not that they remember every conversation. It's that they've built an accumulated understanding — of your clients, your preferences, how you phrase things, what you care about, what you'll push back on. That understanding compounds over time.

Current AI tools — ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini — can store facts about you. "Kevin prefers bullet points." "Kevin has three clients." That's memory. But understanding that your Tuesday client needs a more formal tone than your Thursday client, or that when you say "keep it tight" you mean under 500 words — that's accumulated context. It comes from watching patterns across multiple interactions, across multiple platforms, over time.

The bigger context windows help with within-session coherence. But they don't solve the across-session problem, which is where the real value lives. You shouldn't have to re-explain your entire work context every time you open a new chat.

I've been building a system that tackles this exact problem — syncing context from work platforms and letting it accumulate over time rather than starting fresh every session. What I've found is that the difference between day-1 output and day-90 output is dramatic. Not because the model got smarter, but because the system understands your work better.

The industry is starting to call this the shift from "memory" (storing facts) to "context" (accumulated understanding). I think that's the right framing.

## Opportunity 3 (Position 4: Supervision > Operation)

- **Question:** "Will management consulting jobs like BCG and McKinsey disappear after 10-20 years due to AI?"
- **URL:** https://www.quora.com/Will-management-consulting-jobs-like-BCG-and-McKinsey-disappear-after-10-20-years-due-to-AI
- **Signals:** Perennial question, many answers, but most fall into two camps: "yes, AI replaces everything" or "no, humans are irreplaceable." Kevin has a third framing that's more useful.
- **Kevin's angle:** The replace/augment binary is the wrong frame. The shift is from consultants operating AI (using it as a tool to assist their work) to consultants supervising AI (AI does the analytical work, consultant reviews and directs). 10 years in CRM/GTM gives Kevin direct experience watching this shift happen.

**Draft response:**

I think the "will AI replace consultants" framing misses the more interesting shift that's already happening.

I spent 10 years building CRM and GTM systems — tools that help sales and consulting teams manage client context. What I observed was a pattern that keeps repeating with every wave of technology: the job doesn't disappear, but the operating model fundamentally changes.

The consultants who'll struggle aren't the ones who can't use AI. They're the ones who keep treating AI as an assistant — a tool to help them do slide formatting faster, data crunching quicker, research more efficiently. That's using AI to do the same job slightly faster. Marginal improvement.

The consultants who'll thrive are the ones who shift from operating to supervising. Instead of "I'll use AI to help me write this analysis," it becomes "AI writes the first draft of the analysis from client data I've curated, and my job is to review, refine, and add the strategic judgment that comes from pattern recognition across hundreds of client engagements."

This is a genuinely different operating model. The consultant's value moves from producing deliverables to curating context and exercising judgment. You're not doing the analytical work — you're supervising it. Your value comes from knowing what questions to ask, what data matters, and when the AI's output misses something that only human pattern-matching catches.

I think the BCGs and McKinseys of the world will have fewer people doing what used to require large teams, but those people will each be supervising AI systems that handle the heavy analytical lifting. The question isn't replacement — it's what the job actually becomes when the operating model shifts from "consultant as operator" to "consultant as supervisor."

The firms that figure out this shift first will have an enormous structural advantage. The ones that just bolt ChatGPT onto existing workflows will wonder why the productivity gains are marginal.

## Opportunity 4 (Position 3: The Model Isn't the Product)

- **Question:** "What will AI agents be able to handle in 2025?"
- **URL:** https://www.quora.com/What-will-AI-agents-be-able-to-handle-in-2025
- **Signals:** Forward-looking question with broad engagement. Existing answers focus on model capability improvements. Kevin's "the model isn't the bottleneck" perspective is the contrarian missing voice.
- **Kevin's angle:** Most answers will say "agents will get better as models improve." Kevin's take: we already have incredibly capable models. The bottleneck isn't what the model can do — it's what the model knows about your specific situation. GPT-5 won't fix agents that don't know your work.

**Draft response:**

I'll offer a contrarian take: the bottleneck for AI agents isn't model capability, and it hasn't been for a while.

GPT-4 class models can reason, write, analyze, and plan at a level that would've seemed magical three years ago. Claude can handle nuanced, multi-step tasks with impressive judgment. Yet most people who've tried autonomous agents — Devin, AutoGPT, CrewAI setups — come away disappointed.

Why? It's not because the models aren't smart enough. It's because the agents don't know anything about your specific work.

Ask the best model in the world to "prepare my weekly client update" and it'll produce a competent, generic template. It doesn't know your clients, what happened this week, how you like to structure updates, or what your client cares about. That's a context problem, not a capability problem.

I've been building in this space, and what I've observed is that the same model produces radically different quality output depending on how much accumulated context it has about the user's work. Day one: generic and needs heavy editing. After a few months of accumulated context from work platforms: genuinely useful, needs light review.

So what will agents handle in 2025-2026? My answer: exactly what they can handle now, if the context problem gets solved. The model capability is already there. The missing piece is systems that know enough about your work to put that capability to use. The next wave of useful agents won't be the ones with better models — they'll be the ones with better context.

## Opportunity 5 (Position 5: Cross-Platform Synthesis)

- **Question:** "How does ChatGPT remember context? Is it a new type of deep learning model or just traditional middleware in between?"
- **URL:** https://www.quora.com/How-does-Chat-GPT-remember-context-Is-it-a-new-type-of-deep-learning-model-or-just-traditional-middleware-in-between
- **Signals:** Technical question about architecture. Existing answers explain transformer attention. Kevin can extend into the cross-platform synthesis angle — what happens when "context" goes beyond a single conversation.
- **Kevin's angle:** Within-session context is a solved problem (attention mechanisms). The unsolved problem is cross-platform context — understanding your work as it exists across Slack, email, calendar, and docs simultaneously.

**Draft response:**

The other answers explain the within-conversation mechanics well — attention mechanisms, token-level context tracking, conversation history appended to each API call. All technically accurate.

But I think there's a more interesting version of your question worth exploring: what happens when "context" goes beyond a single conversation?

Right now, ChatGPT's context is the current chat window. Maybe some stored "memories" about you (basic facts like your name, preferences). That's one dimension of context.

But think about how a human assistant understands your work. They see your calendar and know you're meeting with Client X tomorrow. They see your email and know the project timeline shifted. They see your Slack and know your team hit a blocker. They synthesize all of that into understanding — "Kevin has a high-stakes meeting tomorrow, the project is behind, and the team needs direction."

No single platform has that picture. Your email knows your email. Your Slack knows your Slack. Your calendar knows your schedule. The synthesis happens in your head, and it's exhausting.

I've been building a system that connects across these platforms — Slack, Gmail, Calendar, Notion — and what I've found genuinely surprised me. The insights that emerge from cross-platform synthesis are qualitatively different from what any single platform can provide. Patterns that are invisible in isolation become obvious when you see them together.

The next frontier of AI context isn't bigger context windows or better memory features. It's cross-platform understanding — AI that sees your whole work picture, not just one slice of it.
