# YARNNN Activation Playbook

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-23

## Current Stage

- **Product:** MVP live at yarnnn.com
- **Users:** ~50 target (solo consultants)
- **Budget:** $0 (organic only)
- **Team:** Solo founder
- **Raise:** Seed round in motion ($500K–$1M)
- **Key asset:** ClawdBot/OpenClaw narrative (17,830 GitHub stars in 24 hours → acquired by OpenAI)

---

## Strategic Premise

Every piece of content at this stage must do **double duty**:
1. Attract beta users (consultants, founders, ops leads)
2. Build investor-visible presence (VCs should find a trail of signal when they search "yarnnn")

We don't have budget for paid acquisition or a team to sustain high-volume content. This means **high-signal, low-volume**: each post must be worth someone's attention.

---

## Channel Strategy (Ranked by ROI at $0)

### 1. Twitter/X — Primary Channel

**Why:** The AI/founder audience lives here. The ClawdBot crowd is here. Threads are the best organic format for the "context-powered autonomy" narrative. Consultant Twitter is also active.

**Audience:** AI-curious founders, solopreneurs, indie hackers, consultants who use ChatGPT daily

**Format strengths:**
- Threads for storytelling and narrative hooks
- Single tweets for sharp observations and pain points
- Quote tweets for reacting to AI news (ChatGPT failures, agent launches, etc.)

**Cadence:** 3x/week

**Account posture:** Kevin as founder, not a brand account. Personal voice, build-in-public, opinionated takes on AI productivity.

---

### 2. LinkedIn — ICP Channel

**Why:** Consultants and ops leads — our primary ICP — are professionally active here. LinkedIn rewards personal narrative and professional pain points. Less noise in the AI space compared to Twitter.

**Audience:** Consultants, fractional execs, agency owners, team leads, founders with boards

**Format strengths:**
- Personal posts (pain → insight → solution arc)
- Short-form thought leadership (not whitepapers — punchy, opinionated)
- Comment engagement on posts about AI productivity, recurring work, consultant life

**Cadence:** 1x/week

**Account posture:** Kevin as someone who lived the problem (10 years in CRM/GTM, re-explaining context to AI every day) and built the solution.

---

### 3. Reddit + Hacker News — Demand Validation

**Why:** These communities are where the ClawdBot demand signal originated. A well-timed "Show HN" or "I built this" post can generate disproportionate reach.

**Audience:** Developers, early adopters, power users, AI enthusiasts

**Relevant communities:**
- r/ChatGPT, r/artificial, r/singularity (for AI pain point content)
- r/consulting, r/freelance (for ICP-specific content)
- Hacker News (for "Show HN" launch moment)

**Cadence:** 1 post/month max — these communities punish over-promotion

**Important:** Save the "Show HN" moment for when we have 30-day retention data or a compelling demo. One shot — make it count.

---

### 4. Product Hunt — NOT YET

**Why not now:** You get one launch. A weak PH launch is worse than no launch. Save for when you have:
- 30-day retention data proving the compounding loop
- 3+ polished use case testimonials from real beta users
- A demo video that shows the "TP already knows your context" aha moment

**Target timing:** Post-seed, after beta cohort data is in.

---

## Content Pillars

### Pillar 1: The ClawdBot Bridge
**Theme:** "What ClawdBot proved about what people actually want from AI — and what comes next."

This is the highest-signal piece. It connects yarnnn to a known demand event, borrows credibility from the 17,830-star moment, and positions Kevin as someone who saw the signal and built on it.

**Example angles:**
- "ClawdBot got 17,830 GitHub stars in 24 hours. Here's what everyone missed about WHY."
- "OpenAI acquired OpenClaw. But they still haven't solved the real problem."
- "The demand behind ClawdBot wasn't 'AI that remembers.' It was 'AI that works for me.'"

**Best channel:** Twitter thread, cross-posted to LinkedIn

---

### Pillar 2: The Visceral Pain
**Theme:** "Every morning I open ChatGPT and explain my business for the 100th time."

The most relatable content pillar. Anyone who uses AI regularly feels this pain. Low barrier to engagement — people will quote-tweet and comment with their own version.

**Example angles:**
- "I use ChatGPT every day. Every day, it forgets everything. My clients. My projects. How I like things done."
- "AI tools in 2026: incredibly powerful, completely amnesiac."
- "You're not using AI. You're being AI's memory."
- "The real bottleneck in AI productivity isn't the model. It's context."

**Best channel:** Twitter (single tweets), LinkedIn (personal posts)

---

### Pillar 3: The 90-Day Moat
**Theme:** "My AI after 90 days vs. day one — and why that gap is the whole product."

This is the sticky concept. It implies urgency ("you should start accumulating now") and creates a mental model for the compounding value.

**Example angles:**
- "Day 1: AI doesn't know my clients. Day 90: AI writes the client update from Slack context."
- "The AI that's been reading your Slack for 3 months knows things you've forgotten."
- "Switching costs in AI aren't about data lock-in. They're about accumulated understanding."
- Before/after comparison: "What ChatGPT produces vs. what an AI with 90 days of your context produces"

**Best channel:** Twitter thread (with visual comparison), LinkedIn

---

### Pillar 4: Build in Public
**Theme:** Weekly updates on what's being shipped, honest takes on building an AI startup as a solo founder.

This builds trust, creates investor visibility, and generates a cadence that people can follow.

**Example angles:**
- "Week 12: Added signal-emergent deliverables. The system now creates reports I didn't ask for — because accumulated context revealed a pattern."
- "Solo founder shipping an AI platform: here's what I learned about platform sync this week."
- Honest metrics: "50 beta users. Here's what the retention data says about the compounding thesis."

**Best channel:** Twitter, LinkedIn

## Activation Funnel

### Stage 1: Awareness (Content → Curiosity)
**Trigger:** Person sees a tweet/post about the "stateless AI" pain or the ClawdBot narrative
**Goal:** They think "that's exactly my problem" and click through to profile/link

### Stage 2: Interest (Profile → Site Visit)
**Trigger:** They visit yarnnn.com or Kevin's profile
**Goal:** They understand "autonomous AI powered by accumulated context" in under 10 seconds
**Requirement:** Landing page must nail the one-liner and show the Connect → Accumulate → Automate → Supervise flow

### Stage 3: Activation (Signup → First Platform Connection)
**Trigger:** They sign up and connect their first tool (Slack, Gmail, Notion, or Calendar)
**Goal:** They experience "the TP already knows my context" within the first session
**CTA:** "Connect your first tool"
**Critical:** This is where the product must deliver. If the first TP conversation doesn't reference their synced context, the loop breaks.

### Stage 4: Retention (First Deliverable → Compounding)
**Trigger:** First autonomous deliverable arrives, populated with real platform data
**Goal:** They realize the system gets better over time without extra effort
**Aha moment:** "I didn't write this. It pulled from my Slack and Gmail and got it right."

### Stage 5: Advocacy (90-Day User → Referral)
**Trigger:** After 90 days, the accumulated context creates visible quality improvement
**Goal:** They tell other consultants/founders about it
**Mechanic:** No referral program needed yet — word of mouth at this scale is organic

---

## Activation Moments (from GTM_POSITIONING.md)

These are the "aha" moments that convert users, in order of typical encounter:

1. **TP knows your context** — Ask about a project and the TP already knows the details from synced Slack/Gmail
2. **First autonomous deliverable** — A report arrives without prompting, populated with real data from connected platforms
3. **Cross-platform synthesis** — A deliverable combines Slack messages, calendar context, and Notion docs into one coherent output
4. **Improvement over time** — The 5th version needs fewer edits than the 1st because accumulated context made it smarter
5. **Signal-emergent output** — System detects a pattern and suggests a deliverable you didn't think to create

**Implication for onboarding:** Moment #1 (TP knows your context) should happen in the first session. This means platform sync must complete before the user's first TP conversation. Design onboarding to: connect platform → wait for initial sync → prompt a TP conversation that demonstrates context awareness.

## Messaging Tests

At $0 budget, every post is a messaging test. Track which framing gets the most engagement:

| Test | Framing A | Framing B | Metric |
|------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Pain hook | "AI forgets everything" | "You are AI's memory" | Engagement rate |
| Value prop | "AI that works for you" | "AI that gets smarter over time" | Click-through |
| Moat concept | "90-day moat" | "Compounding AI" | Replies/saves |
| ClawdBot bridge | "What ClawdBot proved" | "The next step after persistent AI" | Reach |
| CTA | "Connect your first tool" | "Try the thinking partner" | Signups |

Track informally at this stage. No need for tooling — just note which angles land.

---

## Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Do)

- **Don't launch on Product Hunt yet.** One shot. Not ready until retention data exists.
- **Don't post the same content everywhere.** Twitter/X is punchy and opinionated. LinkedIn is professional narrative. Reddit is technical and authentic. Adapt tone per channel.
- **Don't sell features.** Sell the pain ("AI forgets everything") and the outcome ("AI that works for you"). Features are for the product page.
- **Don't post daily.** Quality > quantity at this stage. Three good tweets per week beats daily noise.
- **Don't create a brand account.** Founder voice > brand voice when you're pre-seed and building trust.
- **Don't write long blog posts.** Nobody reads them at this stage. Threads and short posts only.
- **Don't use jargon.** "Platform_content with retention-based accumulation" → "Gets smarter the longer you use it." (See messaging framework in GTM_POSITIONING.md.)

## First 30 Days — Tactical Plan

**Week 1:**
- Set up Twitter/X profile with clear bio (founder of yarnnn, one-liner, link)
- Publish the ClawdBot bridge thread (Pillar 1)
- First LinkedIn post (Pillar 2 — visceral pain, personal story)

**Week 2:**
- 2x Twitter posts on the "stateless AI" pain (Pillar 2)
- Engage in replies on AI productivity threads, ChatGPT complaint posts
- Identify 10 consultants/founders on Twitter who talk about AI — start engaging

**Week 3:**
- Twitter thread on the 90-day moat concept (Pillar 3)
- LinkedIn post: "What 10 years in CRM taught me about why AI still fails at context"
- First build-in-public post (Pillar 4)

**Week 4:**
- Assess which content pillar generated the most engagement
- Double down on what worked
- Consider a well-crafted r/ChatGPT or r/artificial post if the ClawdBot thread performed well
- Begin planning "Show HN" timing based on beta user data

---

## Success Metrics (30-day)

- **Twitter:** 500+ impressions on ClawdBot thread, 5+ meaningful replies
- **LinkedIn:** 20+ reactions on visceral pain post, 3+ DMs from ICP
- **Signups:** 10 new beta signups from organic content
- **Messaging signal:** Clear winner from framing tests (which hook resonated most)
- **Investor visibility:** At least 1 VC like/comment on a post

These are directional — the real goal is learning which framing converts, not hitting vanity metrics.

---

## When to Revisit This Playbook

- After 30-day retention data from beta cohort is available
- After seed round closes (budget changes everything)
- When Product Hunt launch timing is decided
- If a content piece goes unexpectedly viral (adjust strategy to capitalize)
- When first hire (GTM Lead) joins
