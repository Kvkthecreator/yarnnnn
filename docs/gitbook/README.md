# YARNNN — AI That Works While You Don't

YARNNN is an AI work agent that connects to your everyday tools, learns how you work, and produces real output on your behalf — automatically, on a schedule, improving over time.

## The problem

You spend hours every week on repetitive knowledge work: summarizing Slack threads, prepping for meetings, writing status updates, staying on top of email. AI chatbots can help — but only when you remember to open them, paste in context, and prompt them from scratch every time.

## How YARNNN is different

YARNNN is not a chatbot you talk to when you need help. It's an **AI agent that works autonomously** — reading your Slack, Gmail, Notion, and Calendar, then producing work on a schedule without you having to ask.

| Traditional AI tools | YARNNN |
|---|---|
| You paste context every time | Connects to your tools and stays up to date |
| Forgets everything between sessions | Remembers your preferences and learns over time |
| You do the work, AI assists | AI does the work, you review and approve |
| On-demand only | Runs on a schedule, produces output automatically |

## What you can do with YARNNN

- **Get a weekly Slack digest** — summarizing what happened across your channels, delivered every Monday morning
- **Auto-generate meeting prep** — a briefing pulled from relevant channels and emails, ready before your meeting starts
- **Create status reports** — pulling from Slack, Gmail, and Notion, formatted and ready for review
- **Ask questions with context** — "What did the team decide about the API redesign?" and get answers grounded in your actual Slack and email threads
- **Let it learn** — every time you edit a draft, YARNNN gets better at producing what you want next time

## How it works

1. **Connect** your tools — Slack, Gmail, Notion, Google Calendar
2. **Set up deliverables** — recurring outputs like digests, briefs, and reports
3. **Review and refine** — YARNNN drafts, you approve (or tweak with the AI assistant)
4. **It gets smarter** — learns your style, preferences, and what matters to you
