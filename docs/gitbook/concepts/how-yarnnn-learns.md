# How YARNNN Learns

Most AI tools are stateless — they start fresh every time you use them. YARNNN is different. It **learns from how you work** and gets better the longer you use it.

## Three ways YARNNN learns

### 1. From your conversations

When you tell the assistant things like "I prefer bullet points" or "my team has 8 people," YARNNN remembers. These preferences and facts are stored and applied automatically in future sessions.

You don't need to repeat yourself. Tell YARNNN once, and it knows going forward.

### 2. From your edits

Every time you edit a deliverable before approving it, YARNNN pays attention to *what you changed*:

- You shortened the intro? YARNNN learns to write shorter intros.
- You always add a TL;DR? YARNNN starts including one automatically.
- You prefer a more formal tone? Next version will match.

These aren't one-time adjustments — they become permanent preferences that improve every future deliverable.

### 3. From your patterns

YARNNN quietly observes how you use it:

- Which deliverables you run most often
- What time of day you typically review things
- Which types of edits you make consistently

These patterns inform suggestions (like recommending a new deliverable type) and improve timing and formatting of existing ones.

## What YARNNN remembers

| What it learns | How it helps |
|---|---|
| Your name, role, and company | Personalizes everything from the start |
| Writing style preferences | Matches your tone and format |
| Standing instructions | "Always include action items" is applied everywhere |
| Edit patterns | Anticipates your changes before you make them |
| Usage patterns | Optimizes timing and suggestions |

## You're always in control

Everything YARNNN learns is visible and editable. Go to the **Context** page to:

- **See** everything YARNNN knows about you
- **Edit** anything that's wrong or outdated
- **Delete** memories you don't want
- **Add** new preferences or instructions manually

The system learns automatically, but you own the data and can override anything at any time.

## The compounding effect

Here's why this matters:

- **Week 1**: YARNNN produces decent first drafts. You edit them.
- **Month 1**: Drafts are noticeably better. Less editing needed.
- **Month 3**: Deliverables feel like they were written by someone who knows you.
- **Month 6+**: The system has built a deep understanding of your work — preferences, context history, patterns. Switching to another tool would mean starting from zero.

This isn't just convenience. It's a compounding advantage — **the longer you use YARNNN, the more valuable it becomes, because it accumulates understanding that no other tool has**.
