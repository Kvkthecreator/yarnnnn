# Notion Integration

Connect Notion so YARNNN can read your documents and databases, and include them in deliverables and AI assistant responses.

## What YARNNN can do with Notion

- **Answer questions** — "What's the current status of Project Alpha according to our Notion tracker?"
- **Reference docs** — pull information from your pages when generating deliverables
- **Search your knowledge base** — find relevant content using meaning-based search, not just keywords
- **Cross-reference** — combine Notion content with Slack, Gmail, and Calendar

## Setup

1. Go to **Context** → click **Connect** on Notion
2. Authorize YARNNN through Notion's login screen
3. Select which pages and databases YARNNN should sync

**YARNNN is read-only** — it reads page content but never creates, edits, or deletes pages in your Notion workspace.

## Tips for getting the most out of Notion

- **Sync pages you actively reference** in your day-to-day work
- Databases are synced with their properties and all child pages
- Content updates are picked up on each sync cycle
- You can change your page selection at any time

## Example deliverables using Notion

- **Project status report** — pulls current status from a Notion database
- **Weekly knowledge digest** — summarizes updates to key Notion pages
- **Cross-platform brief** — combines Notion docs + Slack discussions + Gmail threads
