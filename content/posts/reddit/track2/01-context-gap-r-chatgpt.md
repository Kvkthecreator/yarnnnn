<!-- REDDIT TITLE: I've been thinking about why every AI agent — AutoGPT, Devin, crew.ai — eventually disappoints. It's not the models. -->
<!-- TARGET SUBREDDIT: r/ChatGPT -->

I've spent the last year building an AI product, and the single biggest insight I keep coming back to is this: the models are already smart enough. The reason AI agents disappoint isn't capability — it's context.

Here's what I mean. Every few months, a new agent launches with incredible demos. AutoGPT chaining tasks. Devin writing code autonomously. Crew.ai orchestrating multiple agents. The excitement is real. Then people try to use them for their actual work, and the output feels like it was written by someone who started yesterday.

Because it was. Every session starts from zero. The agent doesn't know your clients, your projects, your preferences, your communication style, or what you delivered last week. It's executing tasks in a vacuum.

I started calling this "The Context Gap" — the distance between what a model *could* produce if it understood your work and what it *actually* produces without that understanding.

Ask ChatGPT to write a weekly client update. Structurally correct. Professionally toned. Every fact fabricated. It doesn't know which milestones were hit this week, which Slack conversations revealed a blocker, or which email shifted priorities on Wednesday. The structure is right; the substance is empty.

Now imagine that same model with three months of accumulated context from your actual work platforms. The output references real events, real decisions, real progress. Same model. Dramatically different result.

This is why I think the next breakthrough in AI isn't a smarter model — it's a more informed one. The gap isn't intelligence. It's information.

Memory features (ChatGPT Memory, Claude Projects) are a step, but they store facts ("user prefers bullet points"), not accumulated work context. The distance between "knows your name" and "knows your work" is where the real opportunity is.

Curious if others have noticed this pattern. What's your experience with AI agents producing generic vs. genuinely useful output?
