# Creating Your First Deliverable

A deliverable is a recurring piece of work that YARNNN produces for you automatically. Think of it as a standing order: "every Monday morning, summarize what happened in these Slack channels and have it ready for me."

## Why deliverables matter

Most AI tools wait for you to ask. YARNNN proactively produces work on a schedule — so your Monday morning digest, meeting prep brief, or weekly status report is ready before you even think about it.

## Two ways to create a deliverable

### Option 1: The wizard

1. Go to **Dashboard** → **Create Deliverable**
2. Pick a type:
   - **Digest** — summarize activity across sources
   - **Meeting prep** — briefing before your meetings
   - **Status report** — structured update from multiple tools
   - **Custom** — define your own format
3. Select which sources to pull from (e.g., #engineering + #product channels)
4. Set a schedule (e.g., every Monday at 9am)
5. Save and activate

### Option 2: Tell the AI assistant

Open the assistant and describe what you want:

> "Create a weekly summary of #engineering and #product, delivered every Monday at 9am"

> "Set up a daily meeting prep for my calendar events"

> "I want a bi-weekly status report pulling from Slack and Gmail"

The assistant will configure everything for you.

## What happens after you create one

1. **YARNNN generates a draft** on your schedule
2. **You see it on your dashboard** — read through the draft
3. **Refine if needed** — tell the assistant "make it shorter" or "focus on action items"
4. **Approve** — mark it as done, and it's delivered to your chosen destination
5. **It gets better** — YARNNN learns from your edits and applies them next time

## Your first deliverable: a suggestion

If you're not sure where to start, try this:

> **Weekly Slack Digest** — summarizes your busiest channels, delivered Monday at 9am

It's the simplest way to see YARNNN working for you. After a couple of weeks, you'll notice the summaries start matching your preferences without you having to edit.

## How long until it's "good"?

- **Version 1**: A solid first draft. You'll probably tweak it.
- **Version 2-3**: Noticeably better. YARNNN has learned your style.
- **Version 4+**: Minimal editing needed. It knows what you want.

Every edit you make teaches YARNNN something — preferred length, format, focus areas, writing style. The more you use it, the less you need to touch it.
