# PearX Product Demo Script — v1

**Format**: ~1 min screen recording (QuickTime) with voiceover. You narrate while clicking through the live product.
**Tone**: Casual, confident. You're showing a friend your product, not presenting to a board.
**Tip**: Do a dry run first without recording. Know where you're clicking before you hit record.

## Script (~150 words, ~60 seconds)

**[0:00–0:10] Dashboard + Connections**
*Show: yarnnn dashboard with connected platforms visible*

> So this is yarnnn. You can see I've got Slack, Gmail, Notion, and Google Calendar all connected. These sync automatically — TP is pulling context from all four in the background.

**[0:10–0:25] Chat — The "It Already Knows" Moment**
*Show: Open a new chat with TP. Ask something specific about your work — e.g., "What's the latest on [client name]?" or "Summarize my week."*

> Now watch this — I haven't told TP anything. I'm just going to ask it about a client. And it already knows — because it's been accumulating context from every sync.

*Let TP's response load on screen for a beat. Don't rush it.*

**[0:25–0:45] Deliverable — Autonomous Output**
*Show: Navigate to a deliverable (e.g., a weekly client brief or status digest). Show that it was generated on schedule.*

> And here's where it gets interesting. This is a weekly client brief that TP produced on its own — on schedule, without me prompting it. It pulled from Slack threads, emails, and Notion updates to write this. I just review and edit.

**[0:45–0:60] The Punchline**
*Show: Stay on the deliverable, or go back to the dashboard.*

> Every cycle, it gets better. More context, better output. That's the product — an AI agent that actually learns your work. yarnnn.com.

## Recording Tips

- **Screen only**: No facecam needed — this is a product demo, not a talking-head video
- **Clean up first**: Close unnecessary tabs, hide bookmarks bar, use a clean browser window
- **Zoom in**: Make the text readable — 125-150% browser zoom helps
- **Mouse movement**: Move your cursor deliberately and slowly. Don't dart around.
- **Audio**: Use your regular mic. Speak at a natural pace. It's okay to pause while the screen loads.
- **Mistakes**: If you stumble, just pause and re-say the line — you can trim in QuickTime or CapCut later
- **Length**: Aim for 50-70 seconds. Don't stress about being exact.

## Before You Record

1. Make sure TP has recent synced data so responses look real and specific
2. Pick one actual client or project to reference — specificity sells
3. Have a deliverable already generated so you can navigate to it quickly
4. Close Slack/email notifications so nothing pops up mid-recording
