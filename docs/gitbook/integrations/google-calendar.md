# Google Calendar Integration

Connect Google Calendar so YARNNN knows your schedule — enabling meeting prep, time-aware responses, and schedule-based deliverables.

## What YARNNN can do with Calendar

- **Meeting prep** — generate a briefing before your meetings, pulling context from relevant Slack channels and emails
- **Schedule awareness** — answer "What do I have today?" or "Am I free Thursday afternoon?"
- **Time-based triggers** — run deliverables before specific meetings
- **Cross-reference** — combine schedule context with Slack, Gmail, and Notion

## Setup

1. Go to **Context** → click **Connect** on Calendar
2. Authorize YARNNN through Google's login screen
3. That's it — Calendar syncs automatically

**No source selection needed.** Calendar events are lightweight and broadly useful, so all your calendars sync automatically.

**YARNNN is read-only** — it reads your events but never creates, edits, or deletes calendar entries.

## Example deliverables using Calendar

- **Daily meeting prep** — briefing for each meeting, generated automatically before it starts
- **Weekly schedule digest** — overview of your upcoming week
- **Pre-meeting context pull** — combines calendar events with related Slack and email threads
