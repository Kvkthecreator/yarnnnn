**Format**: Unlisted YouTube video. Founder on camera (talking head). ~60 seconds.
**Tone**: Direct, confident, conversational. Honest, not hype-y. Talk like you're explaining a contrarian bet to a smart friend who knows the AI landscape.

## Script (~160 words, ~60 seconds at natural pace)

**[0:00–0:05] Intro + One-Liner**

> Hi, I'm Kevin Kim. I'm building yarnnn, — an autonomous AI agent that learns your work and produces your deliverables on schedule.

**[0:05–0:18] The Honest Bet (Beat 1)**

> Here's my bet: I know right now, it looks like OpenAI and Anthropic will own everything and every platform cycle looks that way — until it doesn't. Google didn't become Salesforce. Facebook didn't become Shopify. The work economy is shifting, and I still believe the new definition of the "application layer" in the future is still yet to be scaffolded.

**[0:18–0:40] Meet the Product (Beat 3)**

> And that's why I built yarn with our autonomous AI agent name Thinking Partner (TP). TP ]connects to your Slack, Gmail, Notion, and Calendar, and via automated syncs accumulates your work context while you sleep. Then it produces your deliverables on schedule — client briefs, status digests, meeting prep — without being asked. And it gets smarter every cycle. You supervise. TP operates.

**[0:40–0:52] The Insight (Beat 4)**

> Here's why this matters: context, and work orchestration is what makes autonomy meaningful and I think yarnnn has a unique architectural framework to tackle this first hand. After 90 days, your AI knows your clients, your preferences, your patterns. A competitor starting from zero can't replicate that. That's the moat — and that's the bet.

**[0:52–0:60] CTA**

> yarnnn.com is live at beta testing. We're raising a seed round to claim this category while the window is open, and would love to share more. Thank you!

## Recording Notes

- **Setting**: Clean background, good lighting. Webcam or phone is fine — authenticity > production value.
- **Eye contact**: Look at camera, not a script. Internalize the beats, don't read verbatim.
- **Energy**: Start calm and grounded (intro), lean into conviction on the honest bet section ("here's my bet"), build through the product, peak confidence on the insight ("that's the moat — and that's the bet"), then land the CTA warm and direct.
- **The tone shift matters**: v1 opened with frustration ("every day it forgets everything"). v2 opens with intellectual conviction ("here's my bet"). The emotion is different — this is a founder who sees a pattern, not one who's annoyed at his tools.
- **No slides**: This is a talking-head video, not a deck walkthrough. Product demo is a separate optional video (PearX field 8).
- **Length**: Aim for 55-62 seconds. Under 60 is ideal. PearX said "1-min" — respect it.

## What This Script Does NOT Cover (by design)

Per NARRATIVE.md v2 surface adaptation guide:
- **ClawdBot / proof of demand**: Skipped — no time in 60 seconds, and it's in the deck + written answers
- **Work-economy thesis**: Only implicitly present ("gets smarter every cycle," "the moat"). The full two-thesis argument is for the deck and written materials. Video compresses to: honest bet → product → insight.
- **Moat / defensibility**: The one-line mention ("a competitor starting from zero can't replicate that") + "that's the bet" callback to the opener. Full argument is in the deck.
- **Market size / pricing / traction**: In written answers and deck. Video's job is to make them want to learn more.
- **Architecture**: Never in a video. This is a founder-conviction story, not a technical pitch.

## Changes from v1

- **Problem framing**: "AI forgets everything" → platform-cycle honest bet (per NARRATIVE.md v2 anti-pattern)
- **Founder intro**: Now includes the hook ("Here's my bet") — combines intro with contrarian positioning
- **Tone**: Frustration → conviction. The emotional register shifted from "I'm annoyed at broken tools" to "I see a structural pattern and I'm building for it"
- **Insight section**: Added "a competitor starting from zero can't replicate that" for concreteness, and "that's the bet" to callback the opener
- **CTA**: "first two engineers" → "claim this category while the window is open" (matches v15 deck timing language)
