There's a dynamic I've been thinking about that I don't see discussed much in the AI agent space.

Most AI tools deliver flat value. ChatGPT on day 100 is essentially the same as ChatGPT on day 1 for your specific work. The model might have been updated, but its understanding of *your* work hasn't deepened at all. Every session still starts from zero.

But what happens with a system that accumulates context from your work platforms over time?

**Day 1:** It knows almost nothing. Output is generic, needs heavy editing.
**Day 30:** It's seen a month of your Slack, email, calendar. It knows your clients, your projects, your communication patterns. Output is recognizably about your work.
**Day 90:** It's seen patterns across quarters. It knows which client needs formal tone, which project tends to slip, which meetings actually matter. Output needs light editing — it's reviewing, not rewriting.

**The compounding happens across three dimensions simultaneously:**

First, context depth. Going from a shallow snapshot to a month of conversations to three months of project arcs. Not just more data — deeper understanding. The system starts seeing the rhythm of your work, the relationships between clients, how priorities shift over time.

Second, preference learning. Every deliverable you edit teaches the system how you think. You restructure a report's opening — it learns you prefer leading with conclusions. You cut a generic section — it learns to be more specific. You add detail about one client and trim another — it learns where depth matters right now. By day 90, the output converges on what you'd write yourself.

Third, cross-platform synthesis. Early on, the system sees each platform in isolation. Over time, patterns emerge: when a client's Slack activity drops, a concern email usually follows. Your Monday meetings generate action items that appear in Notion by Wednesday. Board meetings on Thursday mean email spikes on Wednesday. These correlations take weeks to emerge but represent understanding no single-platform tool can develop.

**What this creates:** natural switching costs. Not the bad kind — not contractual lock-in or proprietary data formats. The accumulated understanding itself becomes valuable. You can't replicate 90 days of context by signing up for a competitor and starting over. The system's understanding of your work is the moat.

This is fundamentally different from how most AI products work. Switching from ChatGPT to Claude costs you nothing because neither one knew your work anyway. But switching from a context-accumulating system after 90 days means starting over from zero.

**For multi-client professionals, the effect multiplies.** A consultant with six clients develops six parallel context streams. Each deepens independently. By day 90, the system understands not just one client's patterns but the distinct patterns of all six. Switching means restarting all six simultaneously. The cost isn't linear — it's multiplicative.

**What the moat is not:** vendor lock-in through data hostage-taking. The context comes from *your* platforms — your Slack, Gmail, Notion, Calendar. The source data belongs to you. The moat is the accumulated understanding — the learned synthesis of how your work across platforms relates, evolves, and should be reflected in output. Like the difference between raw ingredients and a chef who's cooked for you for three months. The ingredients are portable; the understanding is earned.

**The market implication:** AI tools will bifurcate. Stateless tools compete on model intelligence — a race where every provider accesses the same frontier models and differentiation is thin. Context-accumulating tools compete on depth of understanding — where time is the primary input and switching costs are organic.

I think this has implications the industry hasn't fully absorbed. The "best AI model" race matters less than people think. If accumulated context is what makes output useful, the model is interchangeable — but the context layer isn't.

Has anyone experienced this compounding effect with any AI tool? Or is everyone still in the "every session starts from zero" world?
