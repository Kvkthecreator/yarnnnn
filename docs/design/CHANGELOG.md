## 2026-03-13 — Agent Presentation Principles

- New active doc: `AGENT-PRESENTATION-PRINCIPLES.md`
- Defines first-principled frontend presentation rules for agents as the portfolio grows
- **Core insight**: Users think source-first (platform), not skill-first (processing verb)
- **7 principles**: Source-first mental model, progressive disclosure, card anatomy (source → routine → status), source-affinity grouping, skills as behavioral labels, taxonomy-expansion resilience, chat as long-term creation surface
- **Creation flow**: Source → Job → Configure (inverts current type-first picker)
- **Grouping**: Platform icons as primary visual, source-affinity sections at 6+ agents
- **Template-driven**: Creation options derive from backend config, not hardcoded grids
- Related: agent-framework.md (Scope × Skill × Trigger), SURFACE-ACTION-MAPPING.md, ADR-105

### Active docs (4 docs)
| Doc | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `SURFACE-ACTION-MAPPING.md` | Design principle: directives → chat, configuration → drawer |
| `INLINE-PLUS-MENU.md` | Verb taxonomy (show/execute/prompt/attach) for + menu actions |
| `WORKSPACE-LAYOUT-NAVIGATION.md` | Canonical layout architecture (WorkspaceLayout, scoped chat) |
| `AGENT-PRESENTATION-PRINCIPLES.md` | Agent frontend: source-first grouping, card anatomy, creation flow |

## 2026-03-12 — Context page: knowledge-first landing + file CRUD + versioning

- Default landing changed from `platforms` to `knowledge` (context page + sidebar)
- Knowledge files now clickable with full-content detail view (back-nav pattern)
- User-contributed file creation: title + content class + markdown content
- **ADR-107 Phase 2: Version management** — `KnowledgeBase.write()` auto-archives existing content as `v{N}.md` before overwrite; version history in detail view; `v*.md` excluded from main list
- Backend: `GET /api/knowledge/files/read` + `POST /api/knowledge/files` + `GET /api/knowledge/files/versions`
- Frontend types: `KnowledgeFileDetail`, `KnowledgeFileCreateInput`, `KnowledgeVersion`, `KnowledgeVersionsResponse`
- API client: `knowledge.readFile(path)`, `knowledge.createFile(data)`, `knowledge.listVersions(path)`
- Related: ADR-107 (knowledge filesystem), ADR-106 (workspace architecture)
