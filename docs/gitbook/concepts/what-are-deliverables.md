# What Are Deliverables?

Deliverables are the core of what makes YARNNN an AI agent, not just a chatbot. They are **recurring pieces of work that YARNNN produces automatically, on a schedule, without you having to ask**.

## The idea in 30 seconds

You tell YARNNN: "Every Monday, summarize #engineering and have it ready by 9am."

From then on, every Monday morning, a summary is waiting on your dashboard. You read it, maybe tweak a sentence, approve it, and move on. Over time, the tweaks get smaller because YARNNN learns what you want.

That's a deliverable.

## Why this matters

Most AI tools are reactive — you type a prompt, get a response, repeat. YARNNN is **proactive**. It does work on your behalf while you're not even looking at it:

- Your **weekly digest** runs Sunday night so it's ready Monday morning
- Your **meeting prep** generates an hour before your meeting
- Your **status report** pulls from Slack, Gmail, and Notion — formatted and ready to send

You go from "doing the work with AI help" to "reviewing work that AI already did."

## Types of deliverables

| Type | What it does | Example use case |
|---|---|---|
| **Digest** | Summarizes activity from your sources | "What happened in #engineering this week" |
| **Meeting prep** | Creates a briefing before your meetings | Pre-meeting context from relevant channels and emails |
| **Status report** | Pulls together a structured update | Weekly team update from Slack + Notion |
| **Email draft** | Writes a ready-to-send email | Recurring client update email |
| **Custom** | Whatever you describe | Any format, any sources, any schedule |

## How they get created

There are three ways a deliverable can come into existence:

1. **You create it** — through the wizard or by telling the AI assistant
2. **YARNNN suggests it** — based on your patterns ("You check #sales every morning — want a daily brief?")
3. **Automatically triggered** — when something urgent is detected, YARNNN can generate an immediate summary

## The review workflow

Every deliverable follows the same cycle:

1. **Generate** — YARNNN reads your connected tools and produces a draft
2. **Review** — the draft appears on your dashboard
3. **Refine** — optionally adjust with the AI assistant ("shorter", "more formal", "focus on deadlines")
4. **Approve** — mark as done
5. **Learn** — your edits become preferences for next time

## How they improve over time

This is the part that makes deliverables genuinely useful long-term:

- When you edit a draft, YARNNN notices *what* you changed
- Consistent patterns become permanent preferences (e.g., "you always shorten the intro")
- These preferences are applied automatically in future versions
- By version 3 or 4, most deliverables need minimal editing

**The result**: An AI agent that produces increasingly polished work, tuned to your exact preferences, running on autopilot.

## Scheduling options

| Frequency | How it works |
|---|---|
| **Daily** | Every day at your chosen time |
| **Weekly** | Once a week on your chosen day |
| **Bi-weekly** | Every two weeks |
| **Monthly** | Once a month |
| **Before meetings** | Triggered by calendar events |
