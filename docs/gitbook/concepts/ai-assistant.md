# The AI Assistant

YARNNN includes a built-in AI assistant — available on every screen — that already knows your work context. No pasting, no re-explaining, no starting from scratch.

## What makes it different from ChatGPT, Claude, etc.

The difference is simple: **YARNNN's assistant is already connected to your tools**.

| Generic AI chat | YARNNN's AI assistant |
|---|---|
| You paste in context every time | Your Slack, email, docs, and calendar are already connected |
| Forgets everything between sessions | Remembers your preferences and work style |
| Same generic personality for everyone | Personalized to how you work |
| You drive every interaction | Can work proactively via deliverables |

When you ask "What did the team discuss about the launch?", the assistant searches your actual Slack channels and email threads — not the open internet.

## What you can ask it

### Questions about your work

> "What was discussed in #engineering last week?"

> "Summarize the emails from Sarah about the Q1 budget"

> "What meetings do I have tomorrow and what should I prepare for?"

The assistant pulls from your connected platforms to give you answers grounded in your real work data.

### Cross-platform questions

> "Find everything related to Project Alpha across Slack, Gmail, and Notion"

The assistant can search across all your connected tools in a single query — something you'd otherwise do manually across three different apps.

### Deliverable management

> "Create a weekly digest of #engineering"

> "Make the latest status report shorter and more focused on action items"

> "Pause my daily digest — I'm on vacation"

You can create, refine, and manage deliverables through natural conversation.

### General AI assistance

The assistant is also a capable general-purpose AI. You can ask it to brainstorm, draft, analyze, explain — all with the benefit of knowing your work context.

## Always available

The assistant isn't a separate page you navigate to. It's present on every screen:

- On the **dashboard** — ask questions or create deliverables
- On a **deliverable review** — refine the draft with natural language
- On the **context page** — ask about your connected data

## It remembers you

Between sessions, the assistant retains what it has learned:

- Your name, role, and how you like to work
- Preferences for output style (length, format, tone)
- Standing instructions ("always include a TL;DR")
- Patterns from your usage

This means the more you use YARNNN, the less you have to explain. The assistant adapts to you.
