# Operator profile — Alpha Trader (Simons, Option B)

## Declared strategy
Systematic equity trading across 5–8 measurable signals. Universe
limited to liquid, high-quality US equities + index proxies.
No options, no crypto, no leverage beyond 1.0x.

## Declared universe
Primary: AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, NVDA, AMD, META, TSLA, AMZN,
         SMH, SOXX, QQQ, SPY, XLK, XLY, IWM
(Candidates to add/rotate via quarterly signal audit. Not a
trading wishlist — these are the instruments signals operate on.)

## Declared signals (initial set; evolves via quarterly audit)

### Signal 1: Momentum-breakout
- **Trigger:** 20-day high + price > 50-day SMA + RSI(14) between 55–75 + volume > 1.5x 20-day avg
- **Entry:** next-day open or on-trigger-day close (configurable)
- **Stop-loss:** 2× ATR(14) below entry
- **Target:** 3× ATR(14) above entry OR trailing stop at 1.5× ATR(14) after +2× ATR
- **Position sizing:** 1% portfolio risk (position_size = account_size × 0.01 / stop_distance)
- **Max hold:** 20 trading days; force-exit on day 21 regardless of state
- **Historical baseline (to establish):** target win rate ≥45%, avg win ≥1.5× avg loss, Sharpe ≥0.8

### Signal 2: Mean-reversion-oversold
- **Trigger:** RSI(14) < 25 + price within 5% of 200-day SMA (quality filter) + not in confirmed downtrend (20-day SMA above 50-day SMA)
- **Entry:** next-day open
- **Stop-loss:** 1.5× ATR(14) below entry
- **Target:** RSI returns to 50 OR 2× ATR(14) above entry, whichever first
- **Position sizing:** 0.75% portfolio risk (smaller — mean-reversion has lower expectancy than trend)
- **Max hold:** 10 trading days
- **Historical baseline (to establish):** target win rate ≥55%, avg win ~equal to avg loss, Sharpe ≥0.6

### Signal 3: Post-earnings drift (PEAD)
- **Trigger:** earnings surprise >5% + price gap >3% in surprise direction + hold universe match
- **Entry:** day+1 after earnings at open
- **Stop-loss:** 2× ATR(14) against entry direction
- **Target:** 10-day hold OR 3× ATR(14) profit, whichever first
- **Position sizing:** 1% portfolio risk
- **Max hold:** 10 trading days
- **Historical baseline (to establish):** target win rate ≥50%, asymmetric payoff (avg win ≥1.75× avg loss)

### Signal 4: Sector-rotation-momentum
- **Trigger:** ETF (SMH/XLK/XLY/XLF) relative-strength rank in top 2 of 9 sectors over 20-day window + sector ETF itself in momentum state per Signal 1 rules
- **Entry:** on ETF (not individual stock)
- **Stop-loss:** 2× ATR(14) below entry
- **Target:** trailing stop at 1.5× ATR after +2× ATR
- **Position sizing:** 1.5% portfolio risk (ETF = lower idiosyncratic; slightly larger sizing)
- **Max hold:** 30 trading days
- **Historical baseline:** Sharpe ≥0.7

### Signal 5: Volatility-regime filter (not a trade signal — a portfolio state)
- **Purpose:** reduce sizing across all signals when VIX > 25 AND VIX > 20-day VIX SMA
- **Action:** multiply all signal position_size by 0.5 while regime is active
- **Deactivation:** VIX < 20 for 5 consecutive days
- **Not a signal that generates trades — a global scalar applied in risk sizing.**

(Signals 6–8 reserved — added through quarterly audits as research identifies candidates. Do not add ad-hoc during Alpha-1.)

## Declared edge
Discipline in signal execution, position-sizing math, and signal
retirement. Not in prediction quality. My edge compounds through:
- Consistent sizing (never over-weighting a "high-conviction" trade)
- Diversification across uncorrelated signals
- Retiring signals that decay (don't hope them back to life)
- Never overriding the model

## Success criteria — year-over-year
- Net Sharpe ≥ 1.0 across portfolio
- Max drawdown ≤ 15%
- Per-signal Sharpe within 1.5x of declared baseline (signals
  performing roughly as expected in their regime)
- Zero trades without signal attribution
- At least one quarterly audit per quarter (operator discipline)

## What I'm NOT trying to do
- Not trying to match pro quants on return
- Not trying to beat the index on any single quarter
- Not trying to call market tops or bottoms
- Not trying to swing-trade narrative plays
- Not trying to hold long-term (this is not a buy-and-hold book)
