# yarnnn Positioning & Messaging

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-29

## Core Positioning

**One-liner:** AI agents that run on autopilot

**Tagline:** Build context. Schedule agents. Get work delivered.

**Elevator pitch:**
yarnnn is a proactive AI work platform. Unlike chat-based AI tools where you drive every conversation, yarnnn lets you build project context over time and schedule agents to deliver recurring work—reports, research, content—without you asking.

## The Wedge

**Problem:** AI is interactive. Work is not.

Every AI tool today is pull-based: you ask, it responds. Even with memory features, you're still the one driving. But real work has cadence—weekly reports, ongoing research, regular content. The best employees don't wait to be asked.

**Insight:** The differentiation isn't "AI that remembers" (table stakes). It's "AI that acts."

**Solution:** A platform where:
1. Projects hold isolated context (memories, documents)
2. Agents run on schedule (not when prompted)
3. Work gets delivered (not requested)

## ICP: Multi-Project Operators

Primary targets who manage multiple concurrent workstreams:

### Agencies & Consultants
- **Pain:** Constant context-switching between clients
- **Value:** Each client = isolated project. Weekly status reports write themselves.
- **Activation:** First scheduled deliverable that's actually usable

### Solo Operators & Founders
- **Pain:** Running 5+ things at once, AI forgets everything
- **Value:** Context compounds over months. AI understands your business.
- **Activation:** AI references something from weeks ago without prompting

### Research & Analysis Roles
- **Pain:** Tracking competitors/markets is tedious recurring work
- **Value:** Research agents on schedule, findings accumulate into memory
- **Activation:** Research digest arrives without asking

## Key Differentiators

| Feature | yarnnn | ChatGPT/Claude |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| Context scope | Per-project isolation | Global memory soup |
| Execution | Scheduled, proactive | Interactive only |
| Output model | Deliverables arrive | Responses to prompts |
| Agent model | Multiple specialized | Single assistant |
| Provenance | Full source tracing | Opaque |

## Messaging Principles

### Push over Pull
Work should arrive, not wait to be requested. Scheduled execution beats interactive prompting.

### Context over Conversation
Chat is ephemeral. Memories persist. We optimize for accumulated knowledge, not conversation length.

### Isolation over Mixing
Projects are boundaries. Client A never sees Client B. Clean separation enables trust.

### Transparency over Magic
Every output traces to sources. See what the AI saw. Provenance builds confidence.

## Activation Moments

The "aha" moments that convert users:

1. **First scheduled output** - Agent delivers a weekly summary without prompting
2. **Context recall** - AI references something from 3+ conversations ago
3. **Project switching** - Moving between clients and context just works
4. **Provenance view** - Seeing exactly what memories informed an output

## What We're NOT

- **Not a chat wrapper** - This isn't ChatGPT with a project layer
- **Not a prompt library** - We don't help you write better prompts
- **Not a workflow builder** - No complex automation canvas
- **Not an API** - This is a product, not infrastructure (for now)

## Competitive Positioning

### vs ChatGPT/Claude Memory
They added memory to chat. We built work automation with memory as the foundation. Their memory is passive recall; ours drives proactive output.

### vs Notion AI / workspace AI
They augment documents. We replace the work of creating them. They're co-pilots; we're autopilots.

### vs Custom GPTs / Agents
They're one-off tools you configure. We're a platform where context accumulates and agents evolve with your work.

## Landing Page Structure

### Hero
- Headline: "Your AI team runs on autopilot"
- Subhead: "Build context. Schedule agents. Get work delivered."
- CTA: "Start your first project"

### How It Works (4 steps)
1. Create projects (isolated context spaces)
2. Accumulate knowledge (chat → memories)
3. Schedule agents (recurring work)
4. Work arrives (outputs on schedule)

### Differentiators (4 cards)
- Isolated project context
- Scheduled execution
- Multi-agent orchestration
- Full provenance

### CTA
"Stop driving every conversation"
