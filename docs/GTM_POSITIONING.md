# Yarn GTM Positioning & Messaging

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-30

**Reference:** See [Strategic Synthesis](strategy/STRATEGIC_SYNTHESIS.md) for full framework.

## Core Positioning

**One-liner:** AI that doesn't mix up your clients

**Tagline:** Tell it once. It remembers forever.

**Elevator pitch:**
Yarn is the AI assistant that actually knows your work. Unlike ChatGPT where everything bleeds together, Yarn keeps each client/project in its own world with persistent memory. Upload your docs, chat naturally, and get work done—without explaining yourself every time.

---

## The Three Pain Points

### Pain Point 1: Context Chaos
> "I asked ChatGPT to draft an email for my consulting client, and it used details from a completely different project."

**Problem:** You're juggling multiple clients/projects. Your AI can't keep them straight.

**Solution:** Yarn keeps every project in its own world. Ask about Client A, get only Client A context.

**One-liner:** "Stop mixing up your clients"

---

### Pain Point 2: Groundhog Day
> "I've explained my business model to ChatGPT probably 50 times."

**Problem:** Every time you start a chat, you're starting from scratch.

**Solution:** Tell Yarn once. Upload your docs once. It builds memory that grows over time.

**One-liner:** "Never explain your business twice"

---

### Pain Point 3: Reactive Treadmill
> "I realized I forgot to follow up with a client for three weeks."

**Problem:** AI only works when you're actively prompting it.

**Solution:** Yarn works in the background. Schedule research. Get weekly digests.

**One-liner:** "AI that works while you sleep"

## ICP: Overwhelmed Professionals

Primary targets who need AI that actually knows their work:

### Solo Consultants (Primary)
- **Primary pain:** Context chaos (multiple clients)
- **Secondary pain:** Groundhog day (re-explaining)
- **Pitch:** "Keep your clients straight. Never re-explain."
- **Activation:** AI correctly uses context from the right client

### Freelancers
- **Primary pain:** Groundhog day (new projects constantly)
- **Secondary pain:** Reactive treadmill (missing follow-ups)
- **Pitch:** "Remember every project. Never drop the ball."
- **Activation:** AI references something from previous project conversation

### Remote Workers
- **Primary pain:** Reactive treadmill (no one checking in)
- **Secondary pain:** Context chaos (multiple workstreams)
- **Pitch:** "AI that notices what you're working on."
- **Activation:** Proactive insight surfaces without asking

### Small Business Owners
- **Pain:** All three equally
- **Pitch:** "Your AI chief of staff."

## Messaging Framework

### What to Say

| Instead of... | Say... |
|---------------|--------|
| "Persistent semantic memory" | "Never forgets what you told it" |
| "Multi-project context isolation" | "Keeps your clients separate" |
| "Specialized agent orchestration" | "Different AI helpers for different tasks" |
| "Document ingestion pipeline" | "Upload your files, it reads them" |
| "Proactive scheduled execution" | "Works while you sleep" |
| "Provenance tracking" | "Shows you where answers come from" |

### The Problem → Agitate → Solve

**For landing page / marketing:**

> **Problem:** Your AI keeps mixing things up.
>
> **Agitate:** Working on multiple clients? ChatGPT puts them all in one bucket. Last week it mixed up your proposal for Client A with details from Client B. You caught it—barely.
>
> **Solve:** Yarn keeps every project in its own world. Ask about Client A, get only Client A. Always.

## Competitive Positioning

### vs ChatGPT
"ChatGPT's memory is one big bucket. Yarn gives you separate memory per project. Your clients stay separate."

### vs Claude Projects
"Claude Projects don't persist across sessions. Close the tab, lose the context. Yarn remembers forever."

### vs Notion AI
"Notion AI only knows what's on that page. Yarn knows everything you've ever told it—across all your documents and conversations."

### The Comparison Table

| | ChatGPT | Claude | Yarn |
|---|---------|--------|------|
| Remembers across sessions | Barely | No | **Yes** |
| Keeps projects separate | No | Kinda | **Yes** |
| Works proactively | No | No | **Yes** |
| Shows where answers come from | No | No | **Yes** |
| Price | $20/mo | $20/mo | **$19/mo** |

## Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "ChatGPT has memory now" | "ChatGPT's memory is one big bucket. Yarn keeps clients separate." |
| "I can just use Claude Projects" | "Claude Projects reset when you close the tab. Yarn remembers forever." |
| "I don't have time to set up another tool" | "Sign up, create a project, start chatting. That's it." |
| "Isn't this expensive?" | "Same price as ChatGPT Plus. But Yarn actually remembers." |

## What We're NOT Saying

Avoid technical framing:

## Activation Moments

The "aha" moments that convert users:

1. **Context isolation works** - AI correctly uses only the relevant project's context
2. **Memory recall** - AI references something from 3+ conversations ago
3. **Provenance visible** - User sees "Based on your notes from [date]"
4. **Proactive insight** - AI surfaces something user didn't ask for
