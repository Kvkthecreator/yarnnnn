# Gmail Integration

Connect Gmail so YARNNN can reference your emails and include them in deliverables and AI assistant responses.

## What YARNNN can do with Gmail

- **Answer questions** — "What did Sarah say about the budget in her last email?"
- **Produce email digests** — automatic summaries of important emails
- **Include email context** in deliverables like status reports
- **Cross-reference** — combine email context with Slack, Notion, and Calendar

## Setup

1. Go to **Context** → click **Connect** on Gmail
2. Authorize YARNNN through Google's login screen
3. Select which labels YARNNN should follow (e.g., Inbox, Important, custom labels)

**YARNNN is read-only** — it reads email content but never sends, drafts, or deletes emails.

## Tips for getting the most out of Gmail

- **Start with your most important labels** — Inbox and Important are good starting points
- Project-specific labels work well if you organize email by topic
- Only email body text is synced — attachments are not accessed
- You can change your label selection at any time

## Example deliverables using Gmail

- **Weekly inbox digest** — summary of key emails from the past week
- **Client communication recap** — pulls from a client-specific label
- **Cross-platform status report** — combines Gmail + Slack context
