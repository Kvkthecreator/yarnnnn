# Quickstart — Set Up YARNNN in 5 Minutes

YARNNN is an AI agent that connects to your work tools and produces output on your behalf. Here's how to get started.

## Step 1: Create your account

Sign up at [app.yarnnn.com](https://app.yarnnn.com). You'll land on your dashboard immediately.

## Step 2: Connect your first tool

Click **Connect** on any platform card:

- **Slack** — so YARNNN can read your team conversations
- **Gmail** — so YARNNN can reference your emails
- **Notion** — so YARNNN can access your docs and databases
- **Google Calendar** — so YARNNN knows your schedule

You'll be asked to authorize read-only access. YARNNN never posts, sends, or modifies anything in your connected tools.

All four platforms are available on every plan, including Free.

## Step 3: Choose what to sync

After connecting, pick which sources YARNNN should follow:

| Platform | What you select |
|---|---|
| **Slack** | Which channels to follow (e.g., #engineering, #product) |
| **Gmail** | Which labels to track (e.g., Inbox, Important) |
| **Notion** | Which pages or databases to read |
| **Calendar** | Syncs automatically — nothing to select |

**Tip:** Start with 2-3 high-value sources. You can always add more later.

## Step 4: Talk to the AI assistant

Open the AI assistant from any page and ask something like:

> "What's been happening in #engineering this week?"

> "Summarize my recent emails about the product launch"

> "What meetings do I have tomorrow?"

The assistant already has access to your connected tools — no need to paste anything.

## Step 5: Create your first deliverable

A deliverable is a recurring output YARNNN produces for you on autopilot. For example:

> "Create a weekly digest of #engineering, delivered every Monday at 9am"

You can set this up through the wizard on your dashboard, or just tell the AI assistant what you want.

See [Creating your first deliverable](creating-your-first-deliverable.md) for a full walkthrough.

## What happens next

- YARNNN syncs your sources on a regular schedule
- Deliverables run automatically and produce drafts for your review
- The system learns your preferences and gets better over time
- You review, approve, and occasionally tweak — that's it
