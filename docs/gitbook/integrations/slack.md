# Slack Integration

Connect Slack so YARNNN can read your team conversations and include them in deliverables and AI assistant responses.

## What YARNNN can do with Slack

- **Answer questions** — "What was discussed in #engineering this week?"
- **Produce digests** — automatic weekly summaries of channel activity
- **Surface important threads** — flag urgent or significant discussions
- **Cross-reference** — combine Slack context with Gmail, Notion, and Calendar

## Setup

1. Go to **Context** → click **Connect** on Slack
2. Authorize YARNNN in the Slack login screen
3. Select which channels YARNNN should follow

**YARNNN is read-only** — it reads messages but never posts, reacts, or modifies anything in your Slack workspace.

## Tips for getting the most out of Slack

- **Start with high-value channels** — the ones where decisions happen and important updates are shared
- Both public and private channels (that you're a member of) are available
- You can change your channel selection at any time
- YARNNN syncs recent messages from each channel on a regular schedule

## Example deliverables using Slack

- **Weekly engineering digest** — summary of #engineering activity
- **Cross-team update** — combines #product + #engineering + #design
- **Urgent thread alerts** — immediate summary when something important is detected
