# Yarn GTM Positioning & Messaging

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-02

**Reference:** See [Strategic Synthesis](strategy/STRATEGIC_SYNTHESIS.md) for full framework.

## Core Positioning

**One-liner:** Recurring work that gets better every time

**Tagline:** Set it up once. Review when ready. Watch it learn.

**Elevator pitch:**
Yarn produces your recurring deliverables—weekly client updates, monthly investor reports, research digests—on schedule. But here's what makes it different: every edit you make teaches Yarn what you want. Your 10th delivery is measurably better than your 1st.

## The Core Problem

### What users experience:
- Producing the same types of content week after week
- Using AI that forgets everything between sessions
- Making the same corrections every time ("shorter," "more specific," "different format")
- No measurable improvement over time

### The visceral moment:
> "I've been using ChatGPT for my weekly client updates for 6 months. It still makes the same mistakes it made on day one."

### How competitors fail:
- **ChatGPT:** Forgets everything. Start from scratch every time.
- **Templates:** Static. No learning. Same output forever.
- **Custom GPTs:** Slightly better instructions, but still no feedback loop.

## Yarn's Value Proposition

### The Insight
Your edits are training data. When you change "We achieved strong results" to "Revenue grew 23%," that's not just a fix—it's a signal about what you value.

### The Promise
**Your 10th delivery is better than your 1st.**

Yarn:
1. **Produces on schedule** - Set the frequency, Yarn delivers drafts
2. **Learns from your edits** - Every correction is stored and categorized
3. **Improves over time** - Quality score trends upward across versions
4. **Shows the progress** - See the quality trend, know it's working

## Messaging Framework

### What to Say

| Instead of... | Say... |
|---------------|--------|
| "Persistent semantic memory" | "Learns from your edits" |
| "Scheduled agent execution" | "Produces on schedule" |
| "Edit distance metrics" | "Quality trend" |
| "Feedback categorization" | "Stores your corrections" |
| "Version management" | "Gets better over time" |
| "Context accumulation" | "Remembers what worked" |

### The Problem → Agitate → Solve

**For landing page / marketing:**

> **Problem:** You produce the same types of content every week.
>
> **Agitate:** Weekly client updates. Monthly investor reports. Every time you use AI, you start from scratch. You make the same corrections. "Make it shorter." "Don't include the revenue numbers." "Start with the key takeaway." Next week? Same thing.
>
> **Solve:** Yarn learns from every edit. Set up a recurring deliverable once. Watch the quality trend go up. Your 10th version needs fewer corrections than your 1st.

## Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "ChatGPT is good enough" | "ChatGPT forgets everything. After 10 versions with Yarn, you'll spend half the time editing." |
| "I can just use templates" | "Templates don't learn. Yarn improves based on your corrections." |
| "I don't have recurring deliverables" | "If you produce anything regularly—updates, reports, digests—that's a deliverable." |
| "How do I know it's learning?" | "The quality trend shows it. Each version gets closer to your final edits." |
| "Isn't this expensive?" | "Same price as ChatGPT Plus. But Yarn actually gets better over time." |

## What We're NOT Saying

Avoid technical framing:

- ❌ "Chained agent pipeline"

Avoid old positioning:
- ❌ "Context-aware AI work platform"
- ❌ "Keeps your clients separate" (still true, but not the lead)
- ❌ "AI that remembers" (too generic)
- ❌ "Works while you sleep" (feature, not value prop)
