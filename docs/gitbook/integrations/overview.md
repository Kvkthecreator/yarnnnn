# Integrations — Connect Your Work Tools

YARNNN connects to four platforms to give the AI agent access to your work context. All platforms are available on every plan.

## Supported integrations

| Platform | What YARNNN reads | What you choose |
|---|---|---|
| [**Slack**](slack.md) | Channel messages | Which channels to follow |
| [**Gmail**](gmail.md) | Emails | Which labels to track |
| [**Notion**](notion.md) | Pages and databases | Which pages to sync |
| [**Google Calendar**](google-calendar.md) | Upcoming events | Automatic — no selection needed |

## How it works

1. Click **Connect** on a platform
2. Authorize read-only access through the platform's login
3. Select which sources YARNNN should follow
4. Your content starts syncing immediately

**YARNNN is read-only.** It can see your content but never posts, sends, or modifies anything.

## How many sources can I sync?

| Plan | Sources per platform |
|---|---|
| **Free** | 2 |
| **Starter** | 5 |
| **Pro** | Unlimited |

## The more you connect, the better it works

YARNNN's AI gets better with more context. Connecting multiple platforms means:

- Cross-platform questions work ("find everything about Project Alpha across Slack and Gmail")
- Deliverables can pull from multiple sources (Slack + Notion → status report)
- The AI assistant gives more complete, grounded answers

## Use YARNNN from Claude or ChatGPT

Already use Claude or ChatGPT? You don't have to switch to yarnnn.com to access your work context. The [MCP connector](mcp-connector.md) lets you search your synced content, trigger deliverables, and more — directly from your AI tool of choice.

## Security and privacy

- **Read-only access** — YARNNN never modifies your data
- **Encrypted connections** — all data in transit and at rest
- **Your data is isolated** — no other user can see it
- **Disconnect anytime** — one click to revoke access
