# Connecting Your Tools

YARNNN works by staying connected to the tools you already use. The more it can see, the more useful it becomes.

## How connecting works

1. Click **Connect** on a platform card
2. You're redirected to the platform (Slack, Google, or Notion) to authorize
3. YARNNN gets **read-only access** — it can see your content but never post, send, or change anything
4. You choose exactly which sources (channels, labels, pages) YARNNN should follow

## What each platform gives YARNNN

### Slack — Team conversations

YARNNN reads messages from your selected channels. This means it can:
- Summarize what happened in a channel this week
- Answer questions about team discussions
- Produce recurring digests of channel activity

**You choose:** Which channels to sync. Start with the ones where important decisions happen.

### Gmail — Email context

YARNNN reads emails from your selected labels. This means it can:
- Reference specific email threads when you ask questions
- Include email context in deliverables like status reports
- Help you stay on top of a busy inbox

**You choose:** Which labels to sync. Inbox, Important, or project-specific labels work well.

### Notion — Documents and databases

YARNNN reads your selected Notion pages. This means it can:
- Pull information from your docs when answering questions
- Reference project databases in deliverables
- Search across your knowledge base

**You choose:** Which pages and databases to sync.

### Google Calendar — Your schedule

YARNNN reads your upcoming events. This means it can:
- Generate meeting prep before your meetings start
- Answer "What do I have today?" with your actual schedule
- Factor in your availability when planning

**No selection needed** — Calendar syncs automatically.

## Changing or removing connections

- **Change sources:** Go to **Context** → select a platform → update your selection
- **Disconnect:** Go to **Context** → click a platform → **Disconnect**

When you disconnect, YARNNN stops syncing and removes the connection. Previously synced content expires on its own.

## Privacy and security

- YARNNN has **read-only** access — it cannot post, send emails, or modify your data
- Your data is encrypted and isolated — no other user can see it
- You can revoke access at any time from YARNNN or from the platform's own settings
- OAuth tokens are encrypted at rest
